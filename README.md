# Hot reloading for Node.js apps

Backer is an easy and lightweight way to keep a Node.js aplication up and running without the necesity of manually reload. By the way, Backer doesn't use external libraries.

## How to use it

-Type in your teminal:

```JavaScript:
  $ ./backer <Relative file path to keep track of>
```

After you typed the command you will see back-er initializating its processes, which means simply that your app is been watch correctly, but if you see other message different means something went wrong and your app isn't working as expected.

### Keep in mind

Backer is a currently work in progress, so there will be some mistakes and beta funcionality.
